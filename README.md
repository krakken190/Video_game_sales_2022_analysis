# Video_game_sales_2022_analysis
The project begins by importing the necessary libraries and reading the video games dataset into a Pandas dataframe. The dataframe is then cleaned and missing values are handled before the analysis begins. The project then explores various aspects of the data, such as the top selling platforms, genres, and publishers, as well as the relationship between sales and ratings.

The project uses various data visualization libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib to create clear and informative graphs and charts to help visualize the relationships between different variables. The visualizations include bar charts, scatterplots, heatmaps, and line charts.

FINDINGS:-

The top-selling platform is the PS2, followed by the X360 and the PS3.
The most common game genre is Action, followed by Sports and Shooter.
The most prolific publisher is Electronic Arts, followed by Activision and Namco Bandai Games.
The top-selling game of all time is Wii Sports, with over 80 million copies sold globally.
Sales of video games have generally increased over time, peaking in 2008 and declining since then.
The top developers by global sales are Nintendo, Electronic Arts, and Activision, while the top developers by rating score are Valve Corporation, Rockstar North, and Bethesda Game Studios.
There is a weak positive correlation between critic score and global sales, but no significant correlation between user score and global sales.
Video games with higher ratings tend to have more sales in all regions, with Japan having the weakest correlation.
E-rated (Everyone) games have the highest average sales, while AO-rated (Adults Only) games have the lowest average sales.
The majority of games in the dataset are rated E (Everyone) or T (Teen), with a smaller number of games rated M (Mature) or E10+ (Everyone 10+).
There are missing values in the dataset for some columns, such as critic score, user score, developer, and rating.
The dataset covers video games released from 1980 to 2016, with a concentration of games released in the 2000s and 2010s.
